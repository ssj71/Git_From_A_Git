# Git_From_A_Git
Training for Advanced Git Maneuvers


Overall I'd like to convince you that using Git is valuable and that it is worth spending some extra effort to keep a clean project history. In the process I hope to help you use it a little more powerfully. This is mostly targeted at people who have been using git for a while but aren't actually taking advantage the history. I'll try to explain basic concepts as we come across them but this is not meant to be a total beginners tutorial. 

Most of this exercise is done through the command line, because that is the interface I use the most. I started out using the Git GUI and it helped me get my feet wet, but it also simplified things in a way that soon became limiting. When I always had to turn to the terminal to fix the issues I'd created through the GUI I soon just dropped using the GUI and have just used the command line ever since. You may be using some other interface, a GUI or context menu one. These are fine and hopefully you can figure out how to do all of these commands, but I can't really help much.
